# ArcObjects Json Converters

## Opinionated Json Converters for ESRI ArcObjects

This library aims to simplify interoperability between ESRI
ArcObjects developments and open-sourced projects.

This library provides custom `JsonConverters` for [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/) to export `IGeometry` objects to `geojson`.

*This project is under development...*
